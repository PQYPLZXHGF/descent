**Descent** computes a variety of statistics about consanguineal kin from a population genealogy, including coefficients of relatedness between each member of the population, inbreeding coefficient for each member of the population, average coefficient of relatedness of each member to the entire population, average coefficient of relatedness of each member to their consanguineal kin, number of kin of each population member, patri- and matrilineages, consanguineal connections between members of the population, and number of kin in particular categories (e.g., sisters) for each member of the population. **Descent** also computes the average relatedness of population subgroups (e.g. households), as well as the average relatedness of subgroups to each other. These statistics can then be used in other statistical analyses; for example, to determine the importance of various types of kinship for food sharing, political alliances, etc.
